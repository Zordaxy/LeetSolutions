// 69. Sqrt(x)
// Implement int sqrt(int x).
// Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.
// Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

// Was implemented by Binary search.
