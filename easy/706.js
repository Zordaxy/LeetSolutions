// 706. Design HashMap
// Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries.
// To be specific, your design should include these functions:
// put(key, value) : Insert a (key, value) pair into the HashMap. If the value already exists in the HashMap, update the value.
// get(key): Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or -1 if this map contains no mapping for the key.
// remove(key) : Remove the mapping for the value key if this map contains the mapping for the key.
