// 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
// Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.
// Follow up: The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

// Was implementerd by merge sort similar mechanic
// Better approact is 2 pointers

// Erased from Leetcode.
