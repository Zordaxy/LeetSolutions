// 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
// You are given an integer array nums sorted in ascending order, and an integer target.
// Suppose that nums is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
// If target is found in the array return its index, otherwise, return -1.
