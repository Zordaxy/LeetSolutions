// 450. Delete Node in a BST
// Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.
// Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:
// Search for a node to remove.
// If the node is found, delete the node.
// Follow up: Can you solve it with time complexity O(height of tree)?
