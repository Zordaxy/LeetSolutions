// 162. Find Peak Element
// A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.
// Given an input array nums, where nums[i] ≠ nums[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.
// The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.
// You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.
