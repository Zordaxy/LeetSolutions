// 151. Reverse Words in a String
// Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
// A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
// Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
//Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.


// 1. Approach: Split by ' ', reverse, join by ' '.
// 2. Approach: 2 pointers with detecting start and end of the word
// 3. Approach: rewerse sentence, reverse each word, reverse sentence. Love it!
